# FloodLens

FloodLens is a flood-risk intelligence and MLOps platform for Sri Lanka. It turns
model predictions, environmental signals, monitored locations, and prediction
logs into district-level decisions, emergency priorities, explanations, and
action recommendations.

The product goal is not to be a CSV map or a notebook demo. FloodLens is a
production-shaped prototype of an operational flood-risk decision-support
system.

> Flood risk prediction, explanation, and response prioritization for Sri Lanka.

## Product Positioning

FloodLens helps authorities, planners, insurers, logistics teams, and response
coordinators answer four practical questions:

- Which places are at higher flood risk?
- Why are those places risky?
- Which districts or assets should be prioritized first?
- What action should be considered next?

FloodLens is a decision-support system, not an official emergency alert system.
It should not claim live disaster authority unless connected to verified
real-time government, rainfall, river-gauge, or satellite data.

## Current Implementation

The repository already contains a working MLOps foundation:

- ML training/export pipeline under `ml/`
- saved inference artifact at `artifacts/flood-risk-v3/model_bundle.joblib`
- FastAPI backend under `backend/`
- Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn dashboard under `frontend/`
- JSONL prediction logging under `backend/logs/predictions.jsonl`
- model metadata and monitoring APIs
- interactive Sri Lanka map using MapLibre/mapcn
- monitored-place explorer with district filter, table, inspector, baseline
  risk, risk drivers, priority, and recommended action

Implemented backend APIs:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /model-info`
- `POST /predict`
- `GET /monitoring/summary`
- `GET /districts`
- `GET /locations`
- `GET /locations/{record_id}/record`

Current business layer:

- treats the competition CSV as a seed provider, not the final product data
  source
- preserves raw coordinates while using corrected district presentation
  coordinates for the map
- computes baseline risk before model prediction
- exposes risk drivers, operational priority, asset type, and recommended action
- keeps model-assisted scoring available through `POST /predict`

## Current Code Analysis

The current backend has three useful service boundaries:

- `PredictorService`: loads the saved ML bundle once and serves predictions.
- `PredictionLogService`: appends successful predictions to JSONL and returns
  monitoring summaries.
- `LocationService`: reads seed data, converts rows into business-facing
  monitored places, fixes map presentation coordinates, and computes baseline
  decision signals.

The frontend already has the correct product direction:

- dark operational dashboard shell
- sidebar navigation
- metric cards
- risk explorer
- interactive map
- operational risk queue
- selected-place inspector
- prediction tester
- monitoring view

The most important gap is that decision intelligence is still local to each
location. The next step is to aggregate this intelligence across districts and
prioritized queues so FloodLens feels like a real command platform instead of a
single-location explorer.

## Winning Readiness Against Judging Criteria

FloodLens is already strong as a foundation, but the current implementation is
not yet complete enough to maximize every judging category. The remaining work
must convert the model-serving dashboard into a decision platform with
aggregation, prioritization, feedback, drift monitoring, and a grounded Copilot.

| Judging Area | Current Readiness | What Exists | Missing To Maximize Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scenario Understanding & Solution Design (20%) | Strong | Clear flood-risk decision-support product, monitored-place layer, recommended actions, limitations stated | District-level command view and final demo story tied to response planning |
| Technical Implementation (30%) | Strong foundation | Feature engineering pipeline, ensemble model artifact, FastAPI serving, frontend dashboard, tests | Decision APIs, batch scoring, provider abstraction, richer evaluation/priority outputs |
| MLOps & Production Readiness (25%) | Partial | model bundle, metadata, API serving, prediction logs, monitoring summary, tests | feedback loop, drift summary, CI/CD, Docker verification, retraining trigger story |
| Innovation & Problem Solving (10%) | Partial | business risk drivers, corrected presentation coordinates, operational priority | grounded Copilot, district reports, emergency priority workflow |
| Viva Evaluation (15%) | Good but needs polish | architecture rationale and README positioning | final architecture diagram, demo script, trade-off notes, known limitation answers |

The highest-impact missing pieces are:

1. **Decision Intelligence APIs**
   - `GET /district-summary`
   - `GET /high-risk-locations`
   - `GET /emergency-priority`
   - proves that FloodLens supports district planning and emergency
     prioritization, not only one-location prediction.

2. **Dashboard Decision Views**
   - District Command view
   - High-Risk Locations panel
   - Emergency Priority Queue
   - gives judges a clear, usable workflow with minimal explanation.

3. **Batch Scoring**
   - `POST /batch-predict`
   - score many monitored places and store latest model-assisted score
   - proves realistic workload handling and gives monitoring richer events.

4. **Feedback + Drift Monitoring**
   - `POST /feedback`
   - `GET /monitoring/drift`
   - capture observed outcomes, user confidence, drift status, and retraining
     candidate state.

5. **Grounded Flood Copilot**
   - `POST /copilot`
   - calls internal data tools instead of guessing
   - answers district, location, priority, report, and monitoring questions.

6. **Deployment and CI Evidence**
   - GitHub Actions
   - Docker Compose verification
   - architecture diagram and final demo flow
   - makes the project easy to defend in viva.

## Ultimate UX Plan

FloodLens should feel like an operational command center: dense, calm,
trustworthy, and action-oriented. It should avoid marketing-page layouts,
oversized explanatory copy, AI gimmicks, and decorative visuals that do not help
decisions.

Primary navigation:

- Overview
- Risk Explorer
- District Command
- Priority Queue
- Monitoring
- Copilot

Top status strip:

- API health
- active model version
- monitored places
- predictions logged
- latest prediction time

Core dashboard surfaces:

- **Overview**: model status, prediction volume, high-risk count, average risk,
  latest activity.
- **Risk Explorer**: map + table + district/search filters + selected-place
  inspector.
- **District Command**: district ranking, average risk, high-risk locations,
  critical/elevated priority counts, dominant risk drivers.
- **Priority Queue**: ranked locations for response planning, based on risk,
  population density, evacuation distance, historical floods, and
  infrastructure weakness.
- **Location Inspector**: baseline score, model-assisted score, drivers,
  recommended action, raw vs corrected coordinates, model version.
- **Monitoring**: model version, prediction logs, risk distribution, top active
  districts, feedback, drift/retraining signal.
- **Copilot**: grounded assistant that answers from backend APIs, never from
  unsupported guesses.

UX rules:

- Put actions near decisions: `Predict selected`, `Generate report`, `Mark
  reviewed`, `Add feedback`.
- Show score + reason + action together.
- Use short labels instead of long explanatory paragraphs.
- Use map and tables for scanning; use inspector for details.
- Make the UI understandable without explaining the architecture on-screen.
- Keep risk colors meaningful: green/amber/rose only for risk state.

## Ultimate Technical Plan

FloodLens should be built as a provider-backed MLOps application:

```text
Next.js Dashboard
  -> FastAPI Backend
    -> Decision Intelligence Services
    -> Prediction Service
    -> Monitoring + Feedback Services
    -> Provider Layer
      -> Seed CSV Provider
      -> Future Database Provider
      -> Future Uploaded Asset Provider
      -> Future Weather/Hydrology Provider
    -> ML Inference Bundle
      -> artifacts/flood-risk-v3/model_bundle.joblib
```

Recommended backend services:

- `PredictionService`: single and batch prediction using the saved ML bundle.
- `MonitoredLocationProvider`: interface for assets/places independent of CSV.
- `SeedCsvLocationProvider`: current provider backed by `data/raw/test.csv`.
- `DecisionIntelligenceService`: district summary, high-risk ranking, emergency
  priority, report inputs.
- `MonitoringService`: prediction volume, model version, risk distribution,
  model health, feedback counters.
- `FeedbackService`: collect user feedback and observed outcomes.
- `CopilotService`: grounded LLM orchestration that calls internal APIs/tools.

Recommended API roadmap:

- `GET /district-summary`
- `GET /high-risk-locations`
- `GET /emergency-priority`
- `POST /batch-predict`
- `POST /feedback`
- `GET /monitoring/drift`
- `POST /copilot`
- `POST /reports/district`

Data model direction:

- `MonitoredAsset`
  - `asset_id`
  - `asset_type`
  - `district`
  - `place_name`
  - `latitude`
  - `longitude`
  - `population_density`
  - `rainfall_signals`
  - `river_distance`
  - `evacuation_distance`
  - `infrastructure_score`
  - `baseline_risk`
  - `model_risk`
  - `priority`
  - `drivers`
  - `recommended_action`

MLOps direction:

- saved model artifact with metadata
- reproducible train/export pipeline
- API-serving tests
- frontend lint/build checks
- prediction logs
- feedback logs
- drift checks
- batch scoring
- model card
- CI/CD
- Docker Compose

## Winning Roadmap

Build order matters. The next work should maximize visible business value while
also improving architecture and MLOps depth.

### Phase 1: Provider-Backed Decision Intelligence

Build the highest-value next layer:

- introduce a provider interface so backend logic no longer depends directly on
  CSV internals
- keep the current CSV implementation as `SeedCsvLocationProvider`
- add `DecisionIntelligenceService`
- add:
  - `GET /district-summary`
  - `GET /high-risk-locations`
  - `GET /emergency-priority`
- update frontend with:
  - District Command view
  - High-Risk Locations panel
  - Emergency Priority Queue

Why this matters:

- visible business value for judges
- better technical architecture
- grounded data foundation for the Copilot
- turns prediction into prioritization

Acceptance criteria:

- `/district-summary` returns district count, average baseline risk, high-risk
  count, critical/elevated priority count, and top drivers.
- `/high-risk-locations` returns a sorted list with score, level, priority,
  drivers, and recommended action.
- `/emergency-priority` ranks places by risk, population density, evacuation
  distance, historical floods, and infrastructure weakness.
- frontend shows District Command and Priority Queue without relying on long
  explanatory text.
- backend tests cover sorting, filtering, and empty/default behavior.

### Phase 2: Batch Scoring

Add model scoring at operational scale:

- `POST /batch-predict`
- score all filtered monitored places
- persist latest model score per location in a lightweight store
- show model score vs baseline score
- update district and priority views from scored results

Why this matters:

- stronger MLOps story than one-row prediction
- shows the system can support planning workflows
- creates richer monitoring data

Acceptance criteria:

- `POST /batch-predict` accepts filters such as district and limit.
- the API returns per-location model score, risk level, and model version.
- batch predictions are logged with source `batch`.
- frontend can run batch scoring for the current district.
- monitoring summary includes single vs batch prediction counts.

### Phase 3: Feedback and Monitoring Upgrade

Add learning-loop evidence:

- `POST /feedback`
- capture useful/not useful prediction feedback
- capture observed flood outcome when available
- add monitoring cards for feedback volume, disagreement rate, and retraining
  candidate status
- add simple input drift checks against training/reference data

Why this matters:

- hits MLOps judging criteria directly
- shows the model lifecycle, not just model serving
- creates a clear retraining story

Acceptance criteria:

- `POST /feedback` records record ID, model version, user feedback, optional
  observed outcome, and timestamp.
- monitoring shows feedback count, disagreement count, and retraining candidate
  status.
- drift summary compares recent prediction input ranges/distributions against
  reference training/test data.
- failures return clear API errors and do not corrupt logs.

### Phase 4: Grounded Flood Copilot

Add Copilot only after the decision APIs exist.

Supported questions:

- Which districts are highest risk?
- Why is this location risky?
- Which places should emergency teams prioritize?
- Compare Colombo and Kalutara.
- Generate a district flood-risk report.
- Summarize model monitoring status.

Rules:

- Copilot must call backend tools/APIs.
- Copilot must not invent live rainfall, official warnings, or evacuation orders.
- Copilot should say when data is seed/demo data.
- Copilot should produce decision-support language, not emergency authority.

Acceptance criteria:

- Copilot supports predefined grounded intents first:
  - explain location
  - compare districts
  - list priority locations
  - generate district report
  - summarize monitoring status
- Copilot responses include source data from the backend.
- unsupported questions receive safe limitation language.
- Copilot does not call the model directly when existing decision APIs already
  provide the required facts.

### Phase 5: Deployment and CI/CD Polish

Make the project reproducible:

- Docker Compose for backend/frontend
- GitHub Actions for:
  - backend tests
  - ML tests
  - frontend lint
  - frontend build
- deployment notes for frontend and backend
- architecture diagram
- model card
- demo script

Why this matters:

- proves engineering maturity
- makes viva answers easy
- demonstrates production readiness

Acceptance criteria:

- GitHub Actions runs backend tests, ML tests, frontend lint, and frontend build.
- Docker Compose starts backend and frontend locally.
- README demo commands are current.
- architecture and demo docs match the implemented system.
- final demo can be completed in under five minutes.

## Recommended Demo Flow

1. Open FloodLens dashboard.
2. Show overview: model version, API health, logged predictions, monitored
   places.
3. Open Risk Explorer and filter one district.
4. Select a monitored place.
5. Show baseline risk, drivers, operational priority, and recommended action.
6. Run model prediction for that place.
7. Show the monitoring count update.
8. Open District Command and show district-level risk comparison.
9. Open Priority Queue and show the response-planning ranking.
10. Ask Flood Copilot:
    - "Why is this location risky?"
    - "Which places should be prioritized first?"
11. End on MLOps monitoring: logs, model version, feedback, drift/retraining
    path.

Best judging line:

> We are not only predicting flood risk. We are operationalizing flood-risk ML
> into a decision-support platform that ranks risk, explains drivers, monitors
> predictions, and supports response planning.

## Local Development

artifacts, Python environments, frontend variables, verification commands, and
troubleshooting, use:

- [Zero-to-hero setup guide](docs/setup_guide.md)

Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` under `data/raw/`.

Run ML tests:

```bash
cd ml
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q
```

Run backend tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=backend ml/.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/tests -q
```

Start backend:

```bash
cd backend
../ml/.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Start frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm dev
```

Frontend default backend URL:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Run frontend checks:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

Train/export model:

```bash
cd ml
source .venv/bin/activate
python pipelines/train_pipeline.py --notes "flood-risk-v3 foundation"
```

The exported inference bundle is written to:

```text
artifacts/flood-risk-v3/model_bundle.joblib
```

## Current Limitations

- Current monitored-place data comes from the seed competition CSV.
- Corrected map coordinates are district-level presentation coordinates, not
  verified surveyed asset coordinates.
- The product is not connected to live rainfall, river-gauge, satellite, or
  official emergency feeds yet.
- JSONL logging is used for speed; database-backed storage should come later.
- FloodLens is decision support, not an official alerting system.
